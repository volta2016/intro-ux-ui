# Design and development process of an app

This process starts from the moment you have an idea to find a solution to a specific problem.

During the different stages, designers and developers work most of the time in a simultaneous and coordinated way.11

Everything is born from the need to solve a specific problem.

## Stages of the design process

There is a methodology to provide a solution to a specific problem in only 5 days. This methodology is called **design spring**.

## Conceptualization

- Ideation (starting from a problem, a need that we want to solve)
- Research (If we find a problem or need, we must validate with real information that it is a problem, there must be pure and hard data).
  - there are different ways to collect this information:
  - Interviews to people
  - Surveys
  - User testing

## Definition

In our design process our user must always be at the forefront.

- User definition
- Functionality definition

How we could is an exercise of **design spring**.

user persona and user journey are going to be key
These 2 methodologies allow us to collect information
We can adapt it to allow us to define our users very well, then it allows us to design with those target users or end users in mind.

These techniques are very good to define the functionalities and also allows us to determine the scope of the project.

# Design

The design comes from the idea of how we are going to solve the technical section, all these are points to consider and it is not to take them lightly. But
Once we have already solved who are our users to whom we are designing what are the functionalities which we are designing and which will have our digital product. We are going to get to the design stage where we are going to get down to work, all this information gathered we are going to put it to work and reproduce the design artifacts

- Wireframes
- Mockups (final product, with the right copy)
- Prototypes (Validate ideas, test with users - We will see if the flow is efficient -> a flow would be like bookmarking a song)
- Test with users
- Share with development

# Development

- Implementation of the design to code (pixel perfect - spacing rule - create our frames well inside Figma)
- Design review of the implementation

# Publication

Once it is already tested, not only with users. Check that nothing is broken when working, that the flows work, that the information is correct.
It is made in launching in the different platforms or service depending on the different forms of App. In order to give a follow-up. An example facebook is always having updates, nothing is ever ending, there will always be iterations.

- Launching
- Follow up
- Updating
