# Problem to solve

We have encountered an efficient system for scheduling appointments.
This is something very ambiguous this may be a general problem
and from this you can't design a solution as such.
You cannot generate a digital product in this way, without fundamentals and research.

Barbershop
Age range 18 to 30 years old.

Depending on the project you have to look for those experts.
In this case the expert is the person who owns the barbershop.

- knows about the amount of cuts they do in a day
- number of people visiting the barber shop
- age of the person
- how often they cut their hair

We can design a small survey.
These are techniques that we can apply depending on the project.
