# Application tips

It is very good for us to design digital solutions, it is very good for us to design wareframes, mockups and design wareframes, mockups and solutions to a problem through a digital product.

ðŸ‘€ But you have to know the technical complexity of the solution to that problem.

Types of applications

- Native
- Web
- PWA

Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages.

# Advantages of Native Applications

- Full access to the device, in software and hardware (sensors, camera, etc.)
  **Hardware is everything you can touch - all the sensors your device has**.
  - Example Google Maps access:
  - gps, gyroscope, different sensors to know your location. access this to be able to measure and be able to be giving directions.
- Better user experience: works in a more natural way is more integrated into the operating system by the fact of being native
- Visualization of App stores and integration with smart watches.

If you are going to use the design guidelines for IOS you will have to adapt your designs to those guidelines, but if the solution you are building is custom, **you define your own visual style** you don't need to design for IOS and Android just design with a small size for mobile devices, usually 360px wide is a small resolution for mobile devices and it is good for mobile devices.
for small mobile devices and it is a good base to design for both Android and IO. It all depends on your needs.

# Disadvantages of Native Apps

- Different programming languages and skills depending on the operating system:
  You need different types of programming.

- High costs and development times:
  You need to have a team or a focused person to develop in language that IOS requires and another for language that android requires. Each of the operating systems are different. There are going to be people specialized for the IOS language and another focused for the Android language so it is more expensive to develop, design and create a final product. You have to pay 2 salaries

- They do not appear well positioned in Google searches:
  If they appear in the AppStore stores, because they are embedded inside an App store.

- You have to update them constantly

# Advantages of WEB applications

- Always have the latest version without downloading: Coreen through the browser: Web applications are not stored on your mobile device.

- They do not need to be downloaded, installed or configured.

- Web applications run through the browser, if tomorrow there is an update or requires a new functionality the programmer will send changes and as it is an App that is running in the browser will be updated. You as a user don't need to do anything, you don't need to install them.

# Disadvantages of WEB applications

- They are not found in the official stores of the operating systems.

- They are not found officially in the application stores, you will go to the App store or the play Store and you will not find that application to download it in a normal way.

- Performance limited by browser response. Performance can be very good or very bad depending on the device and the internet. If our target audience or end user are always connected with data, they are always with a wifi network nearby, then a web solution of this type with these advantages and limits can be a solution.

- The functionality without internet is totally discarded

# Advantages of PWA (Progressive Web App)

It unites the best of native applications, the best of web applications. They are applications that are installed on your device, but run in the browser.

A shortcut that you put on your mobile device screen independently of the operating system, makes a shortcut as if it were a web page and when you open it the interface mutates and looks like a native application, it feels like a native application but really, all the processing all the logic is running through the browser. So it also doesn't require that much storage and it's all going to run the browser.

- They don't need to be downloaded, so they don't take up space on the mobile.

- Can be used without internet connection thanks to its **Service Worker** technology.

- No need to develop programming for each operating system (they work with languages focused on the web).

# Disadvantages of PWA (Progressive Web App)

- They cannot access all the functionalities of the devices.

- At the moment not all browsers are compatible with PWAs.

- Their technology does not yet allow you to create very complex sites

So which one to choose ?

It depends, the point is to know the advantages and disadvantages when designing and proposing solutions. You have to design with your users in mind.
